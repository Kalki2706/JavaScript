// BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height)
// (mass in kg & height in meter)

// 1. store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
// 2. Calculate both their BMI's using the formula you can even implement both varsions)
// 3. Create a boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
